# Steps to complete task

1. Load and read a csv or excel file
2. Extract the data from the file
3. transform the data to useful data for performing scikit methods
4. mention the methods used and stored them to a word file as to say why that methods were used
5. print the transformed data store it to a new filename as transformed_{rawfilename}.csv
6. perform analysis on transformed data using scikit learn cheat sheet methods and add to the word file why a method was
   chosen
7. perform the scikit analysis on the transformed data to check which scikit method is useful for analysis
8. use various scikit methods create a cross validation between various ML models on the transformed data and add the
   analysis to a new analysis_on_filename word file
9. print the results of the analysis and store it to a new filename as analysis_{rawfilename}.csv
10. evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score,confusion
    matrix,crossvalidation,variance etc.
11. plot most suitable plots across numerical and categorical columns
12. save the plots to a new filename as plots_{rawfilename}.pdf
13. save the models done on the data to a model_{rawfilename}.pkl
14. To check for oncoming new datasets with this if possible use this model on it if not create new models for it by
    performing above methods
15. store the new model also for future usage
