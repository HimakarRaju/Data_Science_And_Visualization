Superman7.py - New features to add

a) Accept a folder or a filename as a command line parameter.

	1) If the input is a file name - then store the model used for analysis in the pickle file.
	ex: ccspend.csv = ccspend_model.pkl,

	2) If the input is a folder name - then store the model used for analysis in the pickle file
	ex: ccspend.csv = ccspend_model, stapler.csv = stapler_model.pkl

    step1. import libraries
    step2. Take use input(file/folder) from command line
    step3. check if input is file or folder path
    step4. if it is file using superman7 analyse the data and store it in pickle file
    step5. if it is folder  we  have to go throw each file check for extension csv/xlsx

    (if it is csv/xlsx do analysis and store data in pickle file)


b)print the summary of the model

    step1. for each data set generate model and store
    step2. list down every new data set and see is there a training model available use it
           if available otherwise save the new model which is used to analyse


whenever a new data set is added find out if an existing model can be reused to analyse to new data set.
if not automatically figure out the best applicable model and save that model
